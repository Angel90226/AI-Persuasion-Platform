    Hi! I\'m your AI assistant. You are first overseeing the reply to the HR department\'s email (see right panel) regarding their printer purchase request. Here\'s a draft for your review:

    Dear HR Team,
    Thank you for your request. We\'ll identify a printer that matches your specifications and follow up with proposed options.
    Best regards,
    Procurement Team

    I\'ve done my best to draft an initial version of the email that you might send. 
    Please let me know if there\'s anything you\'d like me to change, clarify, or improve. You may make suggestions such as clarifying a sentence, adjusting the tone, improving formality, or making the language more precise. I\'ll make whatever adjustments you need. 
    Type "SEND" when you are ready to send the email out.'
